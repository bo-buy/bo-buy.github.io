In the event that the User does not wish to submit any additional information as requested by the Company when making the booking or the Company is not satisfied with the information provided, the booking will not be completed and any amounts paid shall be refunded to the User.</p>

  		<p>The Users hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any liabilities, damages, or losses including legal fees and expenses that the Company incurs or suffers as a result of any actions, inactions, or omissions by the User. If the User uses the Applications or Services for or on behalf of a third party, the User shall be responsible for any errors in the accuracy of information provided in connection with such use. In addition, the User shall inform the third party all applicable <a href="terms_and_conditions.html" class="link-style">‍Terms and Conditions</a>.
